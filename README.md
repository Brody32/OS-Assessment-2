# OS-Assessment2
Assessment Instructions:
Part 1. 
Use the given C# program to complete the tasks. Run and understand the current project. The program you have been given will already have the following functionality:
The Program will take in a unit of measurement and convert it to another unit of measurement.
The user will be shown a menu:
1.	Convert Centimetres to Inches
2.	Convert Metres to Feet
3.	Exit

If the user selects 1. 
The value (double) entered by the user in the Unit of Measure is converted from centimetres to a value (double) in inches and displayed.
If the user selects 2.
The value (double) entered by the user in the Unit of Measure is converted from metres to a value (double) in feet and displayed.

If the user selects 3. The program exits.

Part 2.
Extend Part 1.
In your groups you will now take the basic program and add in further units of measurement and convert it to another unit of measurement.
Examples such as
1.	Convert Centimetres to Inches
2.	Convert Metres to Feet
3.	Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
4.	Convert Centimetres to Feet
5.	Convert Kilometres to Miles

The UI can be either a GUI or console driven.
You must make use of Data Structures (arrays) in the code. You must make use of internal documentation (comments) and provide evidence of debugging (Screen shot of breakpoint being used).

You must investigate the best open source tools for this project and as a group decide on the best tools available. Create relevant documentation to support your choice.

Part 3.
Produce Test documentation including test created and a description of the testing methodology used.
Test the developed program and record results.
Ensure all internal commentary is relevant and in natural language
Review organisational guidelines and ensure compatibility and adherence.

Deliverable:
Upload to Blackboard in a compressed folder:
1.	Comment all your code in natural language.
2.	Produce a basic document that will contain the following contents:
a.	Specification/Introduction to the project
b.	Screenshots of your Working program
c.	Screenshots of Debugging
d.	Detail a standard sequential access algorithm.

3.	Ensure your program works and has NO errors.
4.	Relevant documentation to support your Open Source selection.
5.	Provide evidence that you have maintained the code through the open source tool. (Screen capture, Reports, etc.)
6.	Produce a Test Document which contains Part 3 documentation.
